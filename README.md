Washer_Machine_Availability-WebApp
==================================

Laundré: an app to help you stay on top of your laundry. 
Laundré displays which machines are in-use in a laundry room based on data received from sensors. The web app lists the closest five laundry locations to the user based on longitude and latitude calculations. Users can request to be texted x minutes before a machine will be available/load will be done and when a machine is available/load is completed. Users are texted in accordance to the order in which they requested to be texted (there is a queue).

Software: Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQLite, HTML, CSS; Twilio API
Hardware: Vibration sensor

To Run Program Locally:
-create virtual environment
-install the packages in requirements.txt
-run app.py (interactively)

Note: I am currently using the Twilio Trial, so only my number has been verified for the texting aspect of the program.
